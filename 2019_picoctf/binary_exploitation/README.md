# Binary Exploitation

## Notes:

- ```./<output_binary_filename>.out```

## 50 -  hand-shellcode
Problem:
- This [program](https://github.com/sabinach/ctf/blob/master/2019_picoctf/binary_exploitation/vuln) executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_2_6ad1f834bdcf9fcfb41200ca8d0f55a6 on the shell server. [Source](https://github.com/sabinach/ctf/blob/master/2019_picoctf/binary_exploitation/vuln.c).

Solution:
- TBD

Flag:
